Guessing Game using GO
  This was one of my favorite project using the GO language. Typically, I would use a while loop to run the game loop, but GO doesn't have the "while" keyword which 
  forced me to learn how to make a "do-while loop" using just a for loop. Take a look, let me know if I can improve on anything!
